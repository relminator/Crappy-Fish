FAQS:
	
	Q: Why another Flappy Bird clone?!
	A: My daughter's wish, is my command. Flappy Bird is a stupid game
	   and this game is almost as stupid as the original. However, this
	   game was one of the easiest games to make so not a lot of
	   manhours was wasted. :p
	
	Q: Can I make a different game out of this engine?
	A: Yes, just give some credits and follow the LGPL terms and conditions.
	
	Q: Can I redistribute this game?
	A: Of course, as long as the whole package stays the same.
	
	Q: Can I sell this game?
	A: No.
	
	Q: Can I publish this game under your name?
	A: Mail me. ;*)
	
	Q: My question is not in this FAQ.
	A: Mail me.
